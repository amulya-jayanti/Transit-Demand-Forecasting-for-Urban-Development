**Transit Demand Forecasting for Urban Development**

Project Summary
This project analyzes transit demand across New York City using data from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), encompassing green/yellow taxis, for-hire vehicles (FHV), and rideshare platforms. Our goal is to uncover actionable insights for urban planning, traffic optimization, and transportation equity using ride-level and geospatial data.

üìä Objectives

Identify high-demand transit corridors and underserved zones\
Analyze rush hour dynamics and ride preference by mode\
Support data-driven infrastructure planning (e.g., new bus routes, congestion relief)\
Evaluate accessibility (e.g., wheelchair support) and demographic reach\
Compare rideshare vs taxi utilization patterns to inform public/private strategies

‚öôÔ∏è Data Processing Pipeline

‚úÖ Preprocessing & Normalization\
Removed null and malformed records\
Converted datatypes, validated numeric ranges, and standardized categorical entries\
‚úÖ Database Modeling\
Normalized raw data to 3NF, created ER diagrams\
Designed a star schema around a fact_ride table with dimensions for time, location, vehicle, and payment\
Loaded data into a local MySQL server for development, then migrated to GCP MySQL for scalability\
‚úÖ Cloud Integration\
Staged data in Google Cloud Storage (GCS), exported final model to SQL dump\
Tables were created via DDL, populated using DML, and cleaned up for production

üîç Insights & Business Use Cases

1. Most Common Routes\
Finding: Top 10 routes are short (<2 miles) and highly concentrated in Manhattan\
Impact: Highlights areas where surface transit (e.g., buses) may be underperforming\
2. Rush Hour Analysis\
Finding: Taxis peak at 5‚Äì6 PM, while rideshares peak at 8 AM and maintain high demand all day\
Impact: Informs driver deployment strategies and demand-specific pricing models\
3. Popular Zones\
Finding: High overlap between pickup/drop-off zones in Midtown & Upper East Side\
Impact: Suggests corridors for targeted infrastructure upgrades\
4. Population vs. Ride Popularity\
Finding: Manhattan far outpaces other boroughs in rides per capita\
Impact: Reveals inequities in transit access and opportunities for outreach in Brooklyn/Bronx\
5. Wheelchair Accessibility\
Finding: ~33% of rideshares accommodate wheelchairs, taxis lag behind\
Impact: Advocates accessibility mandates for traditional taxi fleets

üìà Dashboard Overview

Interactive filters for ride type (taxi vs rideshare)\
Visualized routes, borough-level demand, rush hour patterns, and accessibility coverage\
Designed for urban planners, transit agencies, and transportation providers

üîß Recommendations & Future Work

üîÑ Improve ETL Efficiency\
Use BigQuery with GCS to avoid heavy intermediate transformations\
Adopt Apache Beam/Dataflow for scalable, parallelized ingestion\
üß© Integrate NoSQL for Flexibility\
Use MongoDB for unstructured data (e.g., driver feedback, app logs)\
üìà Expand Business Use Cases\
Revenue optimization via fare modeling during peak/off-peak hours\
Sustainability insights comparing emissions between ride types\
Geospatial layering to correlate demand with income, housing density, and transit deserts\
